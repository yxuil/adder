This is a SPA practice using Flask (REST backend) + vue.js (front end)

## This "app"
is a mockup for an app that I am going to build eventually. Although simplified, it essentially has all the components I need:

1. an input to put in some identifiers
2. a series of operations on selected identifiers
3. and a table that tracks them. The table rows also need to be selectable for manipulation.

I choose Flask to make REST API that takes a list of integers, save them into a database, and depends on what button is press increment or double it. 

I choose Vue.js as front end to handle the UI and user input. I don't know much about javascript yet, and vue.js looks less confusion that other choices. Wish me luck!

## The plan

1. make the REST API. It is simple enough although it is my first attempt. I hope it is a right start.
2. test the API with curl. so far so good.
3. make UI with VueJS:
    a. learn VueJS - read the [document](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ "vuejs guide")
    b. try it out - [this](https://github.com/lh00000000/vue-flask-template "vue-flask-template") and [this](https://github.com/JulienBalestra/vue-flask "vue-flask") might help
    c. Encounter problem, read the [document](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ "vuejs guide") again, and document it
    d. repeat until done
